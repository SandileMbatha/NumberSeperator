The logic for summarizing numbers is on the NumberRangeSummarizer class. There is a helper method called "checkInput" in the class NumberRangeSummarizer that should be private because its only purpose is to provide functionality on the "collect" method but is made public for testing in the TestNumberSeparator Class. This class (TestNumberSeparator) is in charge of testing the NumberRangeSummarizer class's methods, and those tests are run on the TestRunner class.
